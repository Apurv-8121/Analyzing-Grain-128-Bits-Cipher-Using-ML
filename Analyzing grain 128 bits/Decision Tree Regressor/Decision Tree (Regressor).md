# Decision Tree Regressor

A Decision Tree Regressor is a type of machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous target variable. Similar to the Decision Tree Classifier, the Decision Tree Regressor works by splitting the data into subsets based on feature values. However, instead of assigning class labels to the leaves, it predicts a continuous value.

Here's how it generally works:

    > Root Node: The tree starts with the entire dataset.
    > Splitting: At each node, the algorithm splits the data based on feature values to minimize a loss function, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The goal is to create subsets where the target values are as similar as possible.
    > Decision Nodes: The splitting continues recursively at each node, creating smaller subsets until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum tree depth or a minimum number of samples per leaf.
    > Leaf Nodes: Each leaf node represents a predicted value for the data points that reach it. The prediction is typically the average of the target values for the data points in that leaf.

Advantages:

    : Simple to understand and interpret.
    : Can handle both numerical and categorical data.
    : Requires little data preprocessing.

Disadvantages:

    : Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.
    : Can be unstable with small changes in the data, leading to different splits and predictions.

Decision Tree Regressors can also be used as base models in ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, which can help mitigate some of their limitations.
