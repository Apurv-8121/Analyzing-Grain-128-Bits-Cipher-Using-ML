# Decision Tree Classifier
A Decision Tree Classifier is a type of machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by splitting the data into subsets based on the values of input features, creating a tree-like model of decisions.
Here's how it generally works:

    > Root Node: The tree starts with a root node, which represents the entire dataset.
    > Splitting: At each node, the data is split based on a feature that results in the best separation according to some criteria, like Gini impurity or information gain. The aim is to have the most homogeneous subsets after the split.
    > Decision Nodes: The process continues recursively at each new node (which becomes a decision node) until it reaches the leaf nodes.
    > Leaf Nodes: Leaf nodes represent the final output or class labels. Each leaf node corresponds to a class label assigned to the data points that reach it.

Advantages:

    Easy to understand and interpret.
    Requires little data preparation.
    Can handle both numerical and categorical data.

Disadvantages:

    Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.
    Can be unstable, as small changes in data might lead to a completely different tree.

Decision trees are often used as base models for more complex ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines.
