# ANN
ANN stands for Artificial Neural Network, which is a type of machine learning model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain work. ANNs are composed of layers of interconnected nodes, or "neurons," each of which processes input data and passes it on to the next layer. They are used for various tasks like classification, regression, and pattern recognition.
# Relu
ReLU, or Rectified Linear Unit, is a popular activation function used in neural networks. It is defined as:

ReLU(x) = max(0, x) 

This means that if the input is positive, ReLU returns that input; if the input is negative, it returns 0. ReLU helps introduce non-linearity into the network, which is essential for learning complex patterns. It is computationally efficient and helps alleviate the vanishing gradient problem, making it widely used in deep learning architectures.
