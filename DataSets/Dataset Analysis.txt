# Dataset Analysis: 
1) Binary Patterns: Each row in the dataset consists of 58 binary values followed by an index, which 
seems to represent the sequence number of the keystream generated for each random key and IV pair. 
2) Repetition and Uniformity: The output shows a significant amount of repetition, indicating the 
presence of many zeros. This suggests a potential bias in the keystream, which might be due to the 
initial state setup or the properties of the random number generator used. 
3) Cryptographic Strength: For a cryptographic keystream generator, it is crucial that the output bits 
appear random and uniformly distributed. However, the observed repetition and patterns may indicate 
non-ideal randomness, which can be a concern for cryptographic applications. Analysing the 
distribution and randomness of these bits is essential to determine the cryptographic strength of the 
implementation. 
4) Fault Tolerance: The code includes commented-out sections for fault injection, which are intended 
to test the robustness of the keystream generation against faults in the internal state. However, the 
dataset does not show the results of these tests. 

# Potential Improvements: 
1) Randomness Testing: Perform statistical tests such as the NIST suite to evaluate the randomness 
of the keystream. 
2) Fault Injection: Implement and analyse the fault injection tests to understand how faults affect the 
keystream. 
3) Random Seed Initialization: Ensure that the random number generator is properly seeded using 
strand (time (NULL)) to avoid predictable outputs. 
In summary, while the dataset shows the binary output of the Grain-128 algorithm, further analysis 
and testing are required to assess the quality and cryptographic security of the keystream generated.
